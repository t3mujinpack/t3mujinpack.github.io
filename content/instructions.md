# Install/Uninstall/Upgrade

Requirements: These presets are for Darktable only! This version has been tested with Darktable 4.6.x , specially the uninstall script.

## Download
The release package, from version 0.6.0 onwards, comes in two flavors: **flat** and **one-level**, all have the same functionality but displayed in a different structure in the Lighttable and Darkroom modes. You should download the one that suits you the most, between having all styles in a flat list or separated by film type.

### Flat hierarchy
Shows the full, big list without any hierarchy, the way the presets have been show in Darktable until know, ex:

- t3mujinpack – Black and White – Ilford Delta 400
- t3mujinpack – Color Negative – Fuji Pro 160C
- t3mujinpack – Color Negative – Fuji Pro 400H
- t3mujinpack – Color Slide – Kodak Ektachrome 100 GX
- …

### One-level hierarchy
Groups presets into three different sections (Color Slide, Color Negative and Black & White), the presets will appear like this in Darktable styles interface:

- t3mujinpack – Black and White
    - Ilford Delta 400
    - …
- t3mujinpack – Color Negative
    - Fuji Pro 160C
    - Fuji Pro 400H
    - …
- t3mujinpack – Color Slide
    - Kodak Ektachrome 100 GX
    - …

## Install
- Go to Styles box in Lighttable mode.
- Click Import and select all or only the ones you want to install.

It should become available in the styles box or the styles quick access icon in Darkroom mode.

## Uninstall
- Close Darktable.
- Open a Terminal window.
- Go to the folder where the styles were extracted.Run the uninstall script (remove_t3mujinpack.sh for Linux, remove_t3mujinpack.bat for Windows)..
    - This script will try to locate the Darktable database files at its default location. If, for some reason, those are at a different location you can pass that as a script parameter: remove_t3mujinpack.sh /some/folder/data.db
    - A list of installed styles will be shown before deletion.

Styles can also be deleted from Darktable’s Styles box in Lighttable mode.

## Upgrade

There is no direct way to upgrade the styles, the solution is to reinstall them.

Run the Uninstall steps above, it won’t remove the edited images or even delete the keywords associated with the tags.
Install the styles following the steps from above.

# Usage
## TLDR
Just open the image, adjust the basic settings, apply the selected preset, and you’re ready to go.
## The slightly longer version
The big premise of these styles is that it's not meant to be a one stop for the entire processing performed on one photo. These are expected to be applied to an already processed image, as in it's final touch to set it's overall mood and look. 

The recommended processing workflow is something like this:
1. Perform basic exposure adjustment 
2. Set the correct white balance
3. Apply your pixel workflow module, if not already applied by default, this can be _basecurve_, _filmic rgb_ or _sigmoid_
4. Perform other basic exposure or color adjustments, like shadows/highlights or color vibrance/saturation
5. At this point the photo should in a neutral, well exposed level.
6. Apply the **t3mujinpack** style (multiple can be applied, as each one will override completely the previous one)
7. Perform final tweaks on color and exposure, to adjust to the changes from the style 

### Scene Referred or Display Referred 
Because these styles are built on top of the assumption that basic settings are applied, it really is agnostic of this.
