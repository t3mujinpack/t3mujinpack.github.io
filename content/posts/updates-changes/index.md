You may question whether these presets have been abandoned, because the last release is almost five years old! The short answer is: no it's not! The longer answer is: it's complicated and thats why we're here.

## Are the presets still maintaned?
Hell yeah! The reason there hasn't been a release for so long is just lack of organization, to hold on for a bit and properly prepare one: do some testing, make sure everything's alright and create the package release, etc. But it's actively being used, and the code on [Github](https://github.com/t3mujinpack/t3mujinpack) has been contantly updated throughout this time.

Still, a proper version should be released, mostly because Darktable has changed so much since last release, and [one is near](https://github.com/t3mujinpack/t3mujinpack/milestone/4). Hopefully...

## What's new?
 
##### New Site
This one you're browsing.

It made sense to have a home site of its own, and not a page within a personal site.
##### Changes in support
This is to make things easier and handle its growth. Initially the plan was to distribute these via a newsletter and provide support via email. With time this started becoming unsustainable: the subscriber list exceeded the free account limits (and moving to a paid or self-hosted solution wasn't an option), using email to propagate new releases and provide support wasn't the best option. To make things simple all this is moving to Github:
- Issues, including bugs, were already [hosted there](https://github.com/t3mujinpack/t3mujinpack/issues).
- 


##### New home on Github
This one is a bit more invisible to most, the location where the source code. Initially this was hosted in my [personal profile](https://github.com/t3mujin), after all it started as a personal project. But as the audience grew and scope widened it makes sense to move this into its own space, but also to allow the features mentioned above. From now onwards, [this is the new parent](https://github.com/t3mujinpack) on Github, but other than that, all remains the same.
