A long overdue update of t3mujinpack! I was meant to release this version to match the launch of Darktable 3, but a bug related with the edit of existing styles prevented me from editing them, and thus had to wait for Darktable 3.0.1 to be released to wrap this up.

As you might expect from such a huge amount of time since the last release, there are a few updates. First of all, most of existing styles were re-tested and, for many, re-tweaked. Second, a new set of presets of consumer negative films, to complement existing emulations with a different mood. Third, styles can now be grouped so they are more manageable to use, this will be available in a separable download that will work exactly the same, and can even work together.

## New hierarchy modes

### Flat hierarchy

Shows the full, big list without any hierarchy, the way the presets have been show in Darktable until know, ex:

- t3mujinpack – Black and White – Ilford Delta 400
- t3mujinpack – Color Negative – Fuji Pro 160C
- t3mujinpack – Color Negative – Fuji Pro 400H
- t3mujinpack – Color Slide – Kodak Ektachrome 100 GX
- …

### One-level hierarchy

Groups presets into three different sections (Color Slide, Color Negative and Black & White), the presets will appear like this in Darktable styles interface:

- t3mujinpack – Black and White
    - Ilford Delta 400
    - …
- t3mujinpack – Color Negative
    - Fuji Pro 160C
    - Fuji Pro 400H
    - …
- t3mujinpack – Color Slide
    - Kodak Ektachrome 100 GX
    - …
